Dear [Dean/Director Name],

## Transforming Healthcare Education for the AI Era

I am writing to introduce **GreyWaken Medical**, a groundbreaking AI education platform specifically designed for healthcare professionals. As artificial intelligence rapidly transforms clinical practice, we recognize the urgent need for accessible, practical, and HIPAA-compliant AI training for doctors, nurses, and healthcare administrators.

---

## The Challenge We're Addressing

Healthcare professionals face a critical knowledge gap:
- **85%** of clinicians believe AI will impact their practice within 5 years
- **Only 12%** feel adequately trained to use AI tools safely
- **Zero** comprehensive AI courses designed specifically for busy healthcare professionals
- **Growing concern** about patient privacy, bias, and AI errors in clinical settings

Traditional tech courses fail healthcare professionals because they:
- Use abstract examples instead of clinical scenarios
- Ignore HIPAA compliance and patient privacy
- Require coding knowledge
- Don't address medical-specific AI applications

---
